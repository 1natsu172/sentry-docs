# Priority-based Alerts in Sentry

Sentry is rolling out a number of updates to make alerts more actionable. Instead of sending alerts on every new issue by default, we’ll only notify on issues that pass a priority threshold, which will be based on the types of actions that have been taken on similar issues in the past. This change will not affect existing alerts that have been custom configured by you or your team.

The current default alerts within Sentry projects will be modified with a new condition that will filter alerts to only notify on high-priority issues. We'll calculate an importance score for the first event of each new issue. If that first event is deemed to be high-severity or has a fatal log level, we'll alert you. If the first event is low-severity, we'll only alert you if the issue is forecasted to get worse over time.

The high-priority alert condition will notify you if an issue is:

- Similar to issues that have been viewed and responded to quickly in the past, or are likely to be actionable. (Read on for more details.)
- Escalating in volume. For new issues, we’ll compare the hourly event rate to the 95th percentile hourly event rate of other issues in the project.

## How First Event Priority Scores Are Calculated

We initially classify issues based on their log level. Low priority is assigned to issues with log levels `debug` or `info`, while a `fatal` log level is classified as high-priority. Next, our algorithm employs a fine-tuned `gte-small` text embeddings model to convert error messages into a vector of text embeddings. These embeddings, along with additional features like error handling status and the presence of a stacktrace, are then fed into a classification model. This model generates a final score that reflects the first-event severity and nature of the issue.

**Algorithm workflow in detail**

Here's a deeper dive into how the algorithm works:

1. Automatically classify issues with a log level of **debug** or **info** as low priority, and issues with a log level of **fatal** as high priority.
2. Use a fine-tuned version of the [gte-small](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-small) text embeddings model to generate a vector of text embeddings from the error message.
3. Generate our full set of features and pass them to our classification model:
   - Text embeddings
   - Whether or not the error was handled
   - Whether or not a stacktrace is present
4. Return the score, which is then used to classify an issue as high or low priority.
