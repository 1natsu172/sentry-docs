An array of strings or regex patterns that match the URLs of scripts where errors have been created.
Errors that have been created on these URLs won't be sent to Sentry.
If you use this option, errors will not be sent when the top stack frame file URL contains (string) or matches (regex) at least one entry in the `allowUrls` array.

This matching logic applies to captured exceptions not raw message events. By default, all errors are sent.
