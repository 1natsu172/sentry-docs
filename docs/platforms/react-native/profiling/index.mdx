## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Profiling for React Native is available in beta in SDK versions `5.8.0` and above. Currently, it supports profiling the JavaScript layer. Combined profiling with native Android/iOS layers isn't supported at this time.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `profilesSampleRate`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
});
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

Profiling requires Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring to be enabled via `tracesSampleRate` in the example above. Read our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> to learn how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.
