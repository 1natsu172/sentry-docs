## What is OpenTelemetry

## What does Sentry support

1. Performance Powered by OpenTelemetry: üîã
   - This is the topic of this discussion, and has officially been launched with our latest major release of our JS SDK: [v8 Changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/8.0.0)
   - In simple terms, this is the Sentry Node SDK, and our Node.js tracing and performance monitoring features are now largely handled by OpenTelemetry "under the hood" as a dependency of our SDK
   - With these changes we added more auto-instrumentation support for Node frameworks & libraries like Hapi, Fastify, Nestjs, and more
   - We are investigating doing similar for Python, Java, .Net, and other SDKs - no ETA
2. OTel via Span Processor: ‚ôªÔ∏è
    - GA February 2023 Blog [Introducing OpenTelemetry Support: Take Action on Your Observability Data](https://blog.sentry.io/introducing-opentelemetry-support/)
   - This allows developers to take their existing instrumentation done with an OTel SDK and use the Sentry SDK to also send that data to Sentry
   - That means if you have already instrumented with OTel, and want to also send that data Sentry, you can and the Sentry SDK will take OTel span and also Send them to Sentry in the correct format
   - Supported on: [Golang](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/), [Node.js](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/), [Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/), [Ruby](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/ruby/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/), [Java](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/guides/logback/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/), and [.NET](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/ruby/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/)
3. OTLP Endpoint ‚ùå
   - The 3rd option is not our roadmap at the moment, this would be that Sentry would provide an OTLP native endpoint, for you to send your native OTel data from OTEL SDKs to Sentry to run our tracing and performance monitoring products
   - We have investigated it, but for now we do not have a plan to make this user facing, since it would have downsides with our Errors and other products, which OTel SDK cannot propery run today
